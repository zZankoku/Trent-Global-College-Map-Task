User story:
With all the other projects from school piling on and deadlines looming ominiously over me these few weeks, I was reminded of the simpler times when my family and I would visit Bukit Timah market every weekend in the morning to eat our favourite pig intestine kuay zhap. Ocassionally when there were less fortunate vendors that worked in the market that sold tissue papers for a dollar a pack, I remembered always buying the tissues for them regardless of how many spares we had. This also comes with fond memories of my father giving me a dollar to choose what to do with it, instead of buying a new set of duelmasters cards I bought a pack from an old lady that had set up a small stand near the staircase of the market's first floor. My father, seeing this was very proud and offered to buy me a pack of duelmasters cards regardless, this was a very fond memory to me from my childhood. So I was inspired to make this market related map app for all.

Aim:
The goals of this project are to provide a simple and efficient interface for users to easily find markets near them! 
I figured that it would be interesting if you could find out what sort of goods and services were offered in general by a market with just a click of a button.
With this project, users can easily find the location of many markets in Singapore as well as simply view what the markets have to offer.
They are sorted into All Markets, Food markets and Marketing markets.
All markets refer to all the market locations provided in the GEOJson files from the gov.api website
Food markets refer to all the markets that have 0 market produce in them and solely comprise of food stalls
Marketing markets refer to all markets that have both market produce and food stalls

UX:
The CSS files have specified that the maximum size of the map displayed should remain at 100 vertical height which serves to be mobile friendly, the buttons are all reasonably sized and easily used by all users on mobile platforms.

Call to action:
I would like all hawker food enjoyers as well as families that enjoy going out on weekends to explore their next market right here on this app, with its simple and concise ability to sort by different market types to suit their needs.

I programmed this on Visual Studio Code and ran the program using the live server plug in, the link to the server is http://127.0.0.1:5500/index.html
