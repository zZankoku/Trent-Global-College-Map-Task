        <p class="subtitle">By Founder, Zach</p>
        <p>
          With all the other projects from school piling on and deadlines
          looming ominiously over me these few weeks, I was reminded of the
          simpler times when my family and I would visit Bukit Timah market
          every weekend in the morning to eat our favourite pig intestine kuay
          zhap.
        </p>
        <p>So I was inspired to make this market related map app for all.</p>
        <p>
          I would like all hawker food enjoyers as well as families that enjoy
          going out on weekends to explore their next market right here on this
          app, with its simple and concise ability to sort by different market
          types to suit their needs.

        <h2>The Goal</h2>
        <p>
          The goal of this project is to provide a simple and efficient
          interface for users to easily find markets near them!
        </p>
        <p>
          People can find out what sort of goods and services were offered in
          general by a market with just a click of a button.
        </p>
        <p>
          With this project, users can easily find the location of many markets
          in Singapore as well as simply view what the markets have to offer.
